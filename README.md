# Predicting Customer Purchases with a Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model is trained on the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and ensure quality input for modeling.
- **Model Building:** Developed and implemented a decision tree classifier using Python and scikit-learn.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized the model's performance by tuning hyperparameters such as maximum depth, minimum samples split, and criterion using grid search.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its effectiveness in predicting customer purchases.
